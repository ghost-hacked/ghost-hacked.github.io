Hello! This is a repository to host my website.

The image you see on the website is a piece of generative art I made using [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch). A random one is chosen from a collection every time you refresh the page.

If your device is too small, you might not see the image. Sorry about that! Here's a sample:
